When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?

      Creating a remote repository for backup and collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

      There might be nothing to change to make the pull.
      We might want to keep the original work locally and push changes
      to the remote. Doing the inverse automatically might damage what
      we are working on currently.
