When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?

      Creating a remote repository for backup and collaboration.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

      There might be nothing to change to make the pull.
      We might want to keep the original work locally and push changes
      to the remote. Doing the inverse automatically might damage what
      we are working on currently.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

      forks : used to copy from a remote to another GitHub remote.
      clone : used to do a copy from local/remote repository to a local repository.
      branches : used to copy the actual work to experiment new things to the main developed or written files.
